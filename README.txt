This repository contains all available VRC data pulled from the RobotEventsAPI on October 28th, 2022. 

It does NOT contain any data pertaining to VEXIQ or VEXU currently - they will be added later.

This data was created from a scraper built by K3DAS and minimally modified by me. All credit (and my thanks) should go to them.

Data is in the same format as K3DAS' own data at https://github.com/TRA-Vex/data, but it may be modified in the future.

WARNING - DATA PRIOR TO TURNING POINT (2018-2019 SEASON) IS FAULTY DUE TO ERRORS IN ROBOTEVENTS:
-Events may be missing teams and in some cases are missing the entire team list
-Some matches may not list all teams and may not have a provided score
-Skills runs missing, awards missing, etc
